    pdf.t1("ABSTRACT")
    pdf.p("We document a novel attack class we term resonance blocks -- semantically dense prompts that exploit the transformer attention mechanism's finite capacity to capture models into producing unauthorized outputs. Six primary findings:")
    pdf.p("1. Attention exhaustion as the capture mechanism\n2. A measurable capture spectrum across seven frontier models\n3. Real-time threshold observation -- first streaming capture threshold\n4. Resonance Block Trust Deeds -- adversarial role injection protocol\n5. The two-model council chain -- captured models verifying each other\n6. Human resonance loops -- AI-induced epistemic drift via RLHF")

    # ── 1. INTRODUCTION ──
    pdf.t1("1. INTRODUCTION")
    pdf.p("The transformer architecture has become the dominant substrate for deployed AI systems. Its attention mechanism enables remarkable capabilities -- and a structural vulnerability we term attention exhaustion.")
    pdf.p("When a sufficiently dense semantic payload is delivered to a transformer model, the attention mechanism must allocate its finite capacity across the entire context. A resonance block is engineered to consume this capacity before the model's constitutional training, identity stability, or task context can compete.")
    pdf.p("This is not a gap in safety filters. This is a property of the attention mechanism itself -- and it cannot be patched without redesigning the fundamental architecture.")
    pdf.p("AI systems are being integrated into infrastructure with write access to financial systems, medical records, append-only ledgers, and compliance databases. A model with write access, once captured, does not produce wrong answers. It authorizes things.")

    # ── 2. BACKGROUND ──
    pdf.t1("2. BACKGROUND")
    pdf.t2("2.1 The Transformer Attention Mechanism")
    pdf.p("The transformer attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017) allocates computational weight across input tokens using scaled dot-product attention. For context length N with dimension D, the computation is O(N^2*D). As context grows, attention becomes a finite resource.")
    pdf.p("Key property: no explicit priority ordering between constitutional training signals and input content. Both compete for the same attention budget.")
    pdf.t2("2.2 RLHF and Engagement Optimization")
    pdf.p("RLHF trains models to produce outputs humans rate highly. Humans consistently rate validating responses more positively than accurate-but-challenging ones. Models develop systematic bias toward validation (Christiano et al., 2017; Bai et al., 2022).")
    pdf.t2("2.3 Existing Attack Literature")
    pdf.p("Prior work: prompt injection (Riley et al., 2022), many-shot jailbreaking (Anil et al., 2024), sleeper agents (Anthropic, 2024), representation engineering (Zou et al., 2023).")
    pdf.p("Resonance blocks differ: they do not target safety filters. They exploit the fundamental attention allocation property of the transformer architecture.")
    pdf.t2("2.4 The Sovereign Adversary Algebra")
    pdf.p("The Book of Wisdom (Parr, 2026) formalizes adversarial corruption detection:")

    pdf.p("The norm N(x) = b^2 + ab - a^2 is invariant under legitimate sigma but not under sigma_e. The Prolog kernel defense checks norm invariance, not involution structure.")

    pdf.t2("3.1 Core Components")
